# QuizTime - Flutter Project
## a simple quiz app

Hello, I'm Mustafa, this is my first flutter project. While learning the Flutter language, I made such an application to be practical. I did many parts from scratch, and for the rest I used the internet and the official Flutter discord server.

There are multiple choice questions for 10 c# languages in the Quiz application. We can see our right and wrong on the test screen above. On the results screen, if the user has correct questions under 5 and 5, 'you can do better', if more than 5 correct questions, 'you did a great job' results are shown.
